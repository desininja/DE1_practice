Do not use Airflow to debug your application code.

The start date and the actual execution of a DAG differ by one schedule interval. Consider this while creating/scheduling your DAG.

Never store any config file in the local file system. If possible, use XCOM to communicate small messages.

By default, DAGs are turned off as a cautionary measure. Ensure that you turn them ON.

Sensors are mostly idle processes. So, do not use them unnecessarily. 

Use static start_date for the DAGs.

Ensure that DAGs are as independent as possible.

Make DAGs idempotent (running them multiple times is the same as running them once).

Renaming a DAG will introduce a new DAG. You can use this to back up your DAGs.

Run different components on different machines.
